            <h3>How to start the basics.</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose a location in which you will store the local files. Name the folder whatever you'd like.</li>
                <li>In VS Code or similar editor navigate to the folder you created and create a new file, html file. In VS Code you do this by selecting the new file icon, naming it like this "filename.html".</li> 
                <li>Choose a profile picture you would like to display in the page, make sure that it is JPG format for this application. Paste a copy in the folder you just created. Name the file something simple to be referenced later.</li>
                <li>Open the file you just created and insert the following text, in the following format. </li>
                    <div class="layout1">
                        &lt;!DOCTYPE html><br/>
                        &lt;html><br/>
                        &lt;body><br/>
                        &lt;h1>Heading Text&lt;/h1><br/>
                        &lt;img src="./mypic.jpg"/><br/>
                        &lt;p>Paragraph Text&lt;/p><br/>
                        &lt;/body> <br/>
                        &lt;/html>
                    </div>
                <li>Now that the document has its layout its time to add some of your own personal information. In the file you will want to replace "Heading Text" with a title for the portfolio page. Something like My Portfolio. Replace the "Paragraph Text" with some information about you. Use &lt;b> within your text to create a line break. </li>
                <li>On the line &lt;img src="./mypic.jpg" /> replace the "mypic" text with the name of your profile image. This will link its location and allow it to be displayed.</li>
                <li>After you are complete, your finished html file should look something like this.</li>
                    <div class="layout2"> 
                        &lt;!DOCTYPE html><br/>
                        &lt;html><br/>
                        &lt;body><br/>
                        &lt;h1>Mei's Portfolio&lt;/h1><br/>
                        &lt;img src="./meispic.jpg"/><br/>
                        &lt;p>Hi my name is Mei.&lt;/p><br/>
                        &lt;/body> <br/>
                        &lt;/html> 
                    </div>
                <li>Last thing to do is move the complete files to your github repository. Navigate the newly created repository. Select "upload an existing file", upload the html file and portfolio image you placed in your local file folder.</li>
            </ol>
